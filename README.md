## Dependencies
- Python 3
- pandas
- matplotlib
- numpy
- seaborn
- scikit-learn

## Installation
1. Clone this repository:
2. Install the required dependencies using pip:


## Usage
1. Place your training and test datasets (`train.csv` and `test.csv`) in the project directory.
2. Run the `black_friday_sales_prediction.ipynb` notebook to preprocess the data, perform exploratory data analysis (EDA), train the model, and make predictions.
3. View the results and evaluate the model's performance.

## Files Included
- `black_friday_sales_prediction.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the code for data preprocessing, EDA, model training, and prediction.
- `train.csv`: Training dataset containing customer information and purchase details.
- `test.csv`: Test dataset containing customer information (without purchase details).

## Data Preprocessing
- Handle missing values in the dataset.
- Encode categorical variables using one-hot encoding and label encoding.
- Perform feature scaling.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Visualize the distribution of the target variable (Purchase) and other relevant features.
- Analyze correlations between features.
